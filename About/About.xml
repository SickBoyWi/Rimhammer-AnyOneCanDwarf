This mod is a patch for the Rimhammer - The End Times - Dwarfs mod. 

It removes race restrictions on all dawi buildings, and recipes. Therefore, it allows any RimWorld pawn with the required skill and skill level to build dawi stuff, or complete dawi recipes. 

This can safely be added to an ongoing game.

Load this after the Rimhammer - The End Times - Dwarfs mod.
